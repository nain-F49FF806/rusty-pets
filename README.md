# rusty-pets

## About

Have you heard of pet containers?

[![Stop Distro Hopping! Use this AWESOME tool on Linux](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Sj064D9ZUl8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj064D9ZUl8)

Here are recipes for creating your perfect supercharged container images for use with _toolbx_/_distrobox_.
What is the special ingredient that goes into these powerful images?
The Chemical X - it's Rust!

Forged in fires of `cargo` these containers go through an intense build process, supercharging them
with sparkling Rust utils. Some of them enhance your regular shell experience and others unlock new abilities.  
You too wish to discover these oxidised powers, yes ;) ? See instruction below to find out how.

> [!TIP]  
> TL;DR: This repo provides _Toolbox_/_Distrobox_ compatible distro images featuring Rust powered tools.


## How to play

### Installation

You can use these container images with Docker or Podman directly. But you'll have a much better experience
with tools like distrobox/toolbx which neatly wrap the former for convenient local pet container usage.

Install [distrobox] or [toolbx] according to install instructions on respective project page.
We recommend distrobox, since it is supported on various host distributions and is easier to customize.

[toolbx]: https://containertoolbx.org/
[Distrobox install]: https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
[Toolbx install]: https://containertoolbx.org/install/

### Example usage

```bash
## Create a container with any rusty-pets oxidised image (only need to do this once)
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/nain-f49ff806/rusty-pets/fedora-oxidized.toolbox:latest --name fedoraX

## Enter the created container (whenever you please)
distrobox enter fedoraX
```

You can also assign custom home directory for your pets, to keep separate dotfiles for example.

```bash
## Create a rusty-pets distrobox with separate home
mkdir -p ~/Distroboxes/archX
distrobox create --home ~/Distroboxes/archX --name archX --image ghcr.io/nain-f49ff806/rusty-pets/arch-oxidized.toolbox:latest

## Enter the created container (whenever you please)
distrobox enter archX
```
